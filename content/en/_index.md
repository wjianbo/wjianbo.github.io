Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jianbo Wang.  I am from China. 
I learned Japanese at university and graduated with a master's degree. 
Following that, I worked as a translator and translated a dozen books from Japanese to Chinese. 
I have always been interested in programming, so I taught myself. 
Currently, I am employed as a programmer in Japan.
Aside from my professional pursuits, I enjoy running, reading, and playing tennis. 
I also have a passion for writing and aspire to become a writer in the future.
