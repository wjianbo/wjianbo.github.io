Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jianbo Wang. I am from China and currently living in Japan.
I majored in Japanese at university and graduated with a master's degree.
Following that, I worked as a translator and translated a dozen books from Japanese to Chinese.
I have always been interested in programming, so I taught myself.
Currently, I am employed as a programmer in Japan.
I enjoy running, reading, and playing tennis.
I also have a passion for writing and aspire to become a writer in the future.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/wjianbo) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wjianbo).
