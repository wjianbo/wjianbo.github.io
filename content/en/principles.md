Mindsets/Principles
===================
0. CHALLENGE
Don't be afraid of taking challenges.
1. FAILURE
Failure is always possible. Be prepared.
2. IMPORTANCE
Is that important?
3. KISS
Keep it simple, stupid!
4. LEARN IN PUBLIC
A blog isn't considered truly public unless it has a sufficient number of readers.
Telegram is better.
5. REPEAT
> If you’re talking about something new or novel, 
you’ll have to repeat yourself for years before you’re heard.

6. SMALL
Continuously do small things. Take small steps
7. STANDALONE
Don't start challenges like '100 days of xxx' which you never finish. 
Instead, make each task a standalone piece.
